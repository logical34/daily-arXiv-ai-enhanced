Our\nexperiments consider both on-policy and off-policy RL methods, including DPO,\nORPO, and GRPO, to enhance the model calibration. We introduce two novel\nevaluation settings, free-form tagging and iterative tagging, to assess\ndifferent verbalized confidence estimation methods. Experiments on three\nlong-form QA datasets show that our RL-trained models achieve better\ncalibration and generalize robustly across domains. Also, our method is highly\nefficient, as it only requires adding a few tokens to the output being decoded."}

Also, many AUs are excluded\naltogether, making it impossible to fulfill the ultimate goal of FACS-the\nrepresentation of any facial expression in its entirety. This paper considers\nan alternative approach. Instead of creating automated tools that mimic FACS\nexperts, we propose to use a new coding system that mimics the key properties\nof FACS. Specifically, we construct a data-driven coding system called the\nFacial Basis, which contains units that correspond to localized and\ninterpretable 3D facial movements, and overcomes three structural limitations\nof automated FACS coding.

To bridge this gap, we focus on layers and their size, which\nmainly decide the parameter size of Transformers. For this purpose, we first\ntheoretically investigate the layers within the residual stream through a\nbias-diversity decomposition. The decomposition separates (i) bias, the error\nof each layer's output from the ground truth, and (ii) diversity, which\nindicates how much the outputs of each layer differ from each other.

However, video object removal, a critical subtask of video\nediting, remains challenging due to issues such as hallucinated objects and\nvisual artifacts. Furthermore, existing methods often rely on computationally\nexpensive sampling procedures and classifier-free guidance (CFG), resulting in\nslow inference. To address these limitations, we propose MiniMax-Remover, a\nnovel two-stage video object removal approach. Motivated by the observation\nthat text condition is not best suited for this task, we simplify the\npretrained video generation model by removing textual input and cross-attention\nlayers, resulting in a more lightweight and efficient model architecture in the\nfirst stage. In the second stage, we distilled our remover on successful videos\nproduced by the stage-1 model and curated by human annotators, using a minimax\noptimization strategy to further improve editing quality and inference speed.\nSpecifically, the inner maximization identifies adversarial input noise (\"bad\nnoise\") that makes failure removals, while the outer minimization step trains\nthe model to generate high-quality removal results even under such challenging\nconditions. As a result, our method achieves a state-of-the-art video object\nremoval results with as few as 6 sampling steps and doesn't rely on CFG,\nsignificantly improving inference efficiency.

To\nthis end, we propose S4-Driver, a scalable self-supervised motion planning\nalgorithm with spatio-temporal visual representation, based on the popular PaLI\nmultimodal large language model. S4-Driver uses a novel sparse volume strategy\nto seamlessly transform the strong visual representation of MLLMs from\nperspective view to 3D space without the need to finetune the vision encoder.\nThis representation aggregates multi-view and multi-frame visual inputs and\nenables better prediction of planning trajectories in 3D space. To validate our\nmethod, we run experiments on both nuScenes and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (with\nin-house camera data). Results show that S4-Driver performs favorably against\nexisting supervised multi-task approaches while requiring no human annotations.\nIt also demonstrates great scalability when pretrained on large volumes of\nunannotated driving logs."}

We tackle this problem by using numerical\ndigital twins of tissue-mimicking phantoms and the imaging system to perform a\nquantitative calibration to reduce the simulation gap. The contributions of\nthis paper are two-fold: First, we use this digital-twin framework to compare\nmultiple state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. Second, among these is a\nFourier transform-based reconstruction algorithm for circular detection\ngeometries, which we test on experimental data for the first time. Our results\ndemonstrate the usefulness of digital phantom twins by enabling assessment of\nthe accuracy of the numerical forward model and enabling comparison of image\nreconstruction schemes with full-reference image quality assessment. We show\nthat the Fourier transform-based algorithm yields results comparable to those\nof iterative time reversal, but at a lower computational cost.

TC-GS provides plug-and-play acceleration for existing\ntop-tier acceleration algorithms tightly coupled with rendering pipeline\ndesigns, like Gaussian compression and redundancy elimination algorithms.\nAdditionally, we introduce a global-to-local coordinate transformation to\nmitigate rounding errors from quadratic terms of pixel coordinates caused by\nTensor Core half-precision computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour method maintains rendering quality while providing an additional 2.18x\nspeedup over existing Gaussian acceleration algorithms, thus reaching up to a\ntotal 5.6x acceleration.

Semantic-driven routing is evidenced by strong correlations\nbetween attention heads and experts (r=0.68), enabling task-aware coordination.\nNotably, architectural depth dictates robustness: deep Qwen 1.5-MoE mitigates\nexpert failures (e.g., 43% MRR drop in geographic tasks when blocking top-10\nexperts) through shared expert redundancy, whereas shallow OLMoE suffers severe\ndegradation (76% drop).

We conduct extensive\nexperiments on three instruction-awareness downstream tasks across nine\nreal-world datasets, demonstrating that GSTransform improves\ninstruction-following text embedding quality over state-of-the-art methods\nwhile achieving dramatic speedups of 6~300x in real-time processing on\nlarge-scale datasets.
